# üåüFeatures #
1. Uses [double buffering technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering) to create a smooth gameplay. (No flickering of screen/cursor which is a common problem when refreshing the terminal without a graphics library).
2. Colored terminal.
3. Single player mode 
4. AI mode - Watch the snake AI play

# üöÄInstalling #
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Game will work NOT work on online compilers and on Mac OS.

Header files  
  - Snake.h

Source files
  - Snake.cpp
  - GameSnake.cpp

Put header files and source files in the same directory then compile.

# üì∞How to play (Single player mode) #
Use W-A-S-D keys to move snake while avoiding walls and collecting food. (Caps lock of keyboard should be OFF)

The snake grows 5 units each time it eats a food.

If game is over, close all previous terminals before starting a new one.

# üõëLimitations # 
- Snake appears thinner when moving vertically. This is because in the terminal there is small separation between 2 horizontal lines right on top on each other. Unfortunately, nothing can be done to get rid of this line height. 
- For the same reason as above, there is an illusion that the snake moves faster vertically. However, this speed difference was "fixed" by making snake more slower vertically using the sleep function. 
- AI algorithm that uses BFS simply makes snake chase the food as fast as possible. Average score is 300.
- Current Hamilton algorithm takes a lot of time but always results in a win (snake fills board completely).

# üîÆ Future work #
- [x] Food must be generated at free spot
- [x] End game when size of snake ==  total cells in grid
- [x] Output score at the end in the center of grid
- [x] Implement Hamilton algorithm (use an approximation of the longest path from snake head to food)
- [x] Implement a combination of Hamilton and BFS to improve Hamilton
- [ ] Improve food generation algorithm (keep track of unoccupied grid cells)
